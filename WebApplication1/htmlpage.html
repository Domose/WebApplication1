        <p>
            App virtualization (application virtualization) is the isolation of an application from the end
            user's device that is used to access the software.<br /> The application operates from the user's
            viewpoint just as it would if it existed on the local computer of the user. The user can shift or
            adjust<br /> the application window size, and perform the operations of the keyboard and mouse. Often
            there may be slight variations(difference) however,<br /> the consumer will usually have a smooth
            experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Application virtualization, also known as application service virtualization, is a term under the larger umbrella of virtualization.
            It refers<br /> to executing an application or software on a thin client; a terminal or network workstation with few resident programs
            and most programs that<br /> exist on a connected server is accessed. The client runs in an environment isolated from the operating system
            where the program is installed,<br /> often referred to be encapsulated from the operating system that holds the application.
        </p>
        <p>
            Application virtualization tricks a computer into functioning as if the program is running on the local machine, when in reality it's running
            on<br /> a virtual machine (usually a server) situated in another location, using its operating system (OS), and is accessed by the local
            machine’s<br /> operating system. Problems of incompatibility with the operating System of the local computer, or even bugs or low-quality
            code inside the<br /> program, can be solved by running virtual applications.
        </p>

        <div style="background-color:tomato; color:white; padding:20px;"><h2 id="S11">How Application Virtualization Works</h2></div>
        <p>
            While there are several ways to virtualize software, IT teams mostly
            follow a server-based strategy, delivering the software without having
            to<br /> install them on individual desktops. Instead, administrators deploy
            remote applications in the data centre on a server of an organization or<br />
            through a hosting service on a cloud and then distribute them to
            the user's computer.

        </p>
        <p>
            To make this a reality, the IT teams must use an
            application virtualization product. Virtualization software vendors and
            their<br /> products include Microsoft App-V, Citrix XenApp, Parallels
            Remote Application Servers, and VMware ThinApp or App Volumes-
            both of which<br /> are included with VMware Horizon View. VMware
            also provides Horizon Applications to enable application
            virtualisation.

            <span>✔</span><strong>Remote Application Virtualization-</strong> Remote applications run on a server, and end users can see and engage with their applications<br />
            on a network via remote control protocol. Remote programs can be fully integrated with the desktop of the user so that they appear<br />
            and behave as local applications, using technology known as seamless windows. To manage and execute remote applications<br />
            efficiently a constant network connectivity must be maintained.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>✔</span><strong>Streaming Application Virtualization-</strong>The virtualized software is implemented on the local computer of the end-users during<br />
            application streaming. When an application is requested, its components are immediately retrieved on demand from the local<br />
            computer. In order to launch certain parts of the application are required, the rest can be downloaded as needed in the background.<br />
            Upon completion of the download process, a streaming application can run without any network connectivity.

        <div style="background-color:tomato; color:white; padding:20px;"><h2 id="S22">Benefits of App Virtualization</h2></div>
        <p>
            <strong>1. App Management:</strong> Application virtualization makes the management and maintenance of applications in an enterprise much<br />
            simpler for IT departments. Instead of installing apps manually on every user's computer, App virtualization allows IT administrators<br />
            to install  softwares once on a central server and then distribute the application on user devices as necessary. This also makes it easier<br />
            to upgrade or patch applications aside from reducing installation time, as IT just has to do so on a single server.
        </p>
        <p>

            <strong>2. Scalability:</strong> Application virtualization allows IT administrators to distribute virtual applications to all sorts of connected devices,<br />
            irrespective of the operating systems or storage space used by such devices. This allows for thin client load balancing whereby users<br />
            access an application on a low-cost machine while centralized servers manage all the computing power required to run the application.<br />
            As a result, the company spends much less on computer resources as only basic computers are needed for employees to access the<br />
            apps they need for work. App virtualization also enables users to access applications that wouldn't usually execute on the operating system<br />
            of their computers, as the program actually runs on the centralized server. This is widely used to run a Windows program<br />
            directly on a Linux operating system.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>3. Security:</strong> Application virtualization software gives IT administrators central control over which applications users can access. If the<br />
            application permissions of a user inside an organization changes, the IT administrator would simply restrict access of that user to an<br />
            application. Without application virtualization of the app, the IT administrator will have to uninstall the application physically from<br />
            the user's computer. This central control of access to apps is especially useful if a user's devices are stolen or lost, because the IT<br />
            administrator may revoke remote access to sensitive data without having to track the missing device.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>4. Simplified OS deployment:</strong>  Deploying a new OS within your network does not hinder the applications. Also, if you need to<br />
            reinstall an image on a desktop, you don't have to care about the programs running on this computer, as end users can access them on<br />
            the server.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>5. Operating system independent:</strong> Often, virtualized applications are independent of OS. If you have Vista incompatible apps then<br />
            app virtualization of the program could be your solution. Virtualization of software paves the way for Vista x64 too. In a virtual world,<br />
            legacy applications which wouldn't work on a 64-bit device could run without problems on Vista x64. You can also run complex<br />
            Windows apps on Linux and OS X alongside Wine and Crossover.
